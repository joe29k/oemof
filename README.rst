**This repo is a fork of https://github.com/oemof/oemof intended to remove dependencies from deprecated oemof subpackages causing problems with macOS. Although this problem was reported in https://github.com/oemof/oemof/issues/119 and solved in the branch https://github.com/oemof/oemof/tree/revision/only_maintained_software, as long as this branch is not integrated into the main oemof branch, the H2Powerplant tool uses this fork to ensure availability (using the oemof dev branch directly in our dependencies might lead to the program not functioning if the branch gets removed in the future). After integration of this feature into a future oemof version in the future, the H2Powerplant tool might be altered to use such a version direct. If this is the case, this fork than could be removed.**

**PLEASE DO NOT USE THIS FORK FOR ANYTHING OTHER THAN THE H2POWERPLANT TOOL.**

Open Energy Modelling Framework (oemof)
=======================================

.. figure:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oemof/oemof/master/logo/logo_oemof_big.svg

The Open Energy Modelling Framework (oemof) is a Python toolbox for energy system modelling and optimisation.

The oemof project aims to be a loose organisational frame for tools in the wide field of (energy) system modelling.
Every project is managed by their own developer team but we share some developer and design rules to make it easier to understand each other's tools. All project libraries are free software licenced under the MIT license.

All projects are in different stages of implementation, some even may not have a stable release, but all projects are open to be joined by interested people.
We do not belong to a specific institution and everybody is free to join the developer teams and will have the same rights.
There is no higher decision level.
